            Hi, my name is Thomas Huber, I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at Arizona State University. The overarching purpose
            of this website is that I like making stuff, and this is where I can organize / reference / exhibit it.

        <p>
            I've been coding since I was ~11 years old, in that time, I've learned various programming languages, a list of them in decreasing
            level of familiarity would be: JavaScript, C++, Golang, Java, Python, Lua, Rust, C#. I started with Unity and
            C#, but I've moved away from that and am now mostly interested in Machine Learning, Fullstack Web Development,
            Computer Science, and Indie Game Development. Aside from coding I like graphic design, and physically creating
            things e.g. electronics and woodworking.
